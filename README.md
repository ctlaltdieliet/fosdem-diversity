# Making FOSDEM more inclusive bottom up

### What is the problem?

FOSDEM is great! FOSDEM is unique. But FOSDEM can be better.
FOSDEM is lacking diversity. Some dev rooms are more diverse (like the community dev room, of course!)
We have seen an increasement through the years but we can do better, right?


### What can we do about this?

We are the open source community! If we want to improve something, we just start doing it, bottom up! 
You can't change all this as a single person, but **as a community we can change this**!

### Our goals for FOSDEM 2025

These are our minimum goals

-  5 or more scholarships for people that are underrepresented, covering all the costs during the event
-  10 buddies during the whole event each dedicated to one person with a disability to help getting where they want
-  20 very visible buddies during the whole event accross the campus being there to help people
-  1 low-stimulus room
